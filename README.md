# Redis Caching with Node.js 🚀

This repository contains a simple Express.js application integrated with **Redis** (using the `ioredis` package) to demonstrate **caching**, **TTL (time-to-live)**, and basic **get/set** operations.

## 📌 What is Redis?

**Redis** (Remote Dictionary Server) is an in-memory data structure store, commonly used as a **cache**, **message broker**, and **database**. It supports key-value pairs and data structures like lists, sets, and hashes.

### 🔍 File Descriptions

- **client.js**
  - Initializes and exports a Redis client using the `ioredis` package.
  - Can be reused across multiple files.

- **index.js**
  - A simple Express server that:
    - On GET `/`, checks if `todos` is cached.
    - If cached → returns it.
    - If not → fetches from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`, caches it in Redis with a TTL of 30 seconds, then responds.

- **ttl.js**
  - Demonstrates how to:
    - Set expiry (TTL) manually on a Redis key (`msg:6`).
    - Retrieve and log the value.
    - Useful for learning and testing TTL behavior in Redis
